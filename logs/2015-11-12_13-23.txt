Senior project log for 2015-11-12_13-23
Time logged: 1hr
Finished the disassemble function, which *should* be the last part of the
database library. Now I'm going to work on writing a *very simple* agent, with
two inputs and one output, just to test to see if everything will compile ok.
If that all works I'll be ready to move on to something more complex that can
actually test the effectiveness of the database structure.
