Worked out a function for returning the most similar memory in the database
given a specific input. It uses a tunable metric for stopping and branching,
which I think will be great for performance. I also decided over winter break
that the entire concept of storing actions was useless, seeing as the agent
will need to be able to work without them in the first place, shouldn't be
drawing on them much anyways, and they could always be stored in a new input
if absolutely needed for something, so I removed actions from the code.
