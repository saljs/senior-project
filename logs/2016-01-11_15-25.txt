Senior project log for 2016-01-11_15-25
Time logged: 5
I started working on the specific functions for the demo! Had a ton of issues
getting OpenCV's Mat object to be stored in a void* but I got it eventually. I
have getInput() like halfway written now! Also some minor changes to the
master branch of the project.
