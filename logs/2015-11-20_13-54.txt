Senior project log for 2015-11-20_13-54
Time logged: 7h
Thought up a simple test of the code so far that will also allow to mess with
OpenCV a bit. It will just be two input system, pictures with colored shapes
and text. The inputs will then be processed, comparing the text with other
words, and using FLANN feature matching and comparing histograms with the
Bhattacharyya method. I will then hopefully to be able to train it to
recognize and output chapes and colors. Not really stretching the algorithm to
it's limits or anything, but a good simple proof of concept anyways. As for
what I did during this time was to draw out some flowcharts, and experiment
with OpenCV's various image comparrison methods before I settled on the two
above. Some good resources I came across were:
