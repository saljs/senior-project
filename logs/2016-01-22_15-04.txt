Senior project log for 2016-01-22_15-04

Ok, so lots on lots of bugfixing went on, just small piddly stuff that would
break something or another here or there. First the database save/restore funtions were
reading files in a random order, so I replaced the whole thing with a flat
file concept. Then that was reading it in backwards, so I fexed that. Then it
turned out strtok rewrited the string passed to it, so I had to re-memmove the
original data before calling it a second time in my compare funtion. Then I
fixed an off by one error in the getInputs function. I also wrote an ascii box
visualtion graphic for the database, just to easily see what it's doing
instead of having to dump and sort through variables.
