Senior project log for 2015-09-29_14-18
Time logged: 5h
Read chapters 2+3. Chapter 2 focused on intelligent agents, and how the
environment the agent was running in would affect the design of the agent. It
also talked about how the agent would need to keep a model of its environment
in memory. Chapter 3 was all about decision making using search algorithms,
which find a number of steps to get to a goal state. I think the decision
making system for my finished AI will be a lot more complex than I originally
pictured, but certainly doable. Very excited!
