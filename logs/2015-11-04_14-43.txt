Senior project log for 2015-11-04_14-43
Time logged: 15hrs
Knocked out about 300 lines of code for saving the memory structure to the
disk then rebuilding it on reload. Also had my legit proposal meeting, a bit
of a formality, but I will admit I do have a better grasp on the path the
project will take and the timeline since the original proposal was approved.
I've also revised the memory structure quite a bit. So I have a couple more
database functions, but then it's on to building a test input/output code base
and a test agent, then actually compiling it all for the first time.
