Senior project log for 2016-05-25_14-56
Time logged: 35
Got the code all done! The MPI stuff was a lot harder than I thought, but my
cluster processes images a lot faster now that I have it working. Probably
because there's now 24 CPUs plugging away at it instead of one. The only
remaining bug is that it takes a very long time to process very dark images,
which isn't really a bug just an optimazation problem. I initialized the
neural net with some sane defaults for obstical avoidance and light seeking,
the robot mostlyt goes left. I mean, most problems can be caused by turning
left so it's not like it doesn't work.
