Senior project log for 2016-01-13_13-54
Time logged: 9

Created a makefile and compiled the code, which segfaulted immediatly. Which I
expected to be honest. Spent a long time debugging a bunch of memory issues
and a couple infinite loops. Right now I'm on to trying to get the save and
restore funtions to work properly, they keep erring out with an error code of
Success. Makes no sense. I'll fix it tomorrow maybe.
