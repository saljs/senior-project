Senior project log for 2015-10-14_14-31
Time logged: 3h
I realized that I had made a pretty big oversight in my save to disk function,
and was actually writing a pointer to the disk instead of the actual data. So
I'm currently working to rewrite it, about 100x times more complex. On the
upside I learned how to handle directories in C.
