Senior project log for 2015-10-07_15-00
Time logged: 3h
Read through chapter 4, which talked about Search algorithms that generate a
series of actions instead of solving something. I then created a flowchart
that better illustrates how my program will differentiate between the different
tasks it has. I also started looking into possible live resources. Tomorrow
I'm going to start coding a rough framework.
