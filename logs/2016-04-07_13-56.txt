Senior project log for 2016-04-07_13-56
Time logged: 34h
Ok, so it's been a little while since I've logged anything, kind of got out of
the habit. But I've got neural nets DOWN, and feel pretty great about
simulated annealing, which has always made sense to me but now I feel good
about programming it. I finished my old flight simulator game, my opponents
now have the brain I've been meaning to give them for a couple years. I only
finished it 30mins ago, so they're still super dumb and keep crashing into
things, but I'm going to let it run for a couple days and see how they do. I
also have a killer idea for my showcase product. I plan to rebuild a better
version of my robot from my gennetic algorithms project, complete with full
color camera, improved battery pack and a great brain. I plan to connect up my
database structure to act as a memory, then pipe that along the inputs into a
rather big neural network. That will then drive two motors and a simulated
annealing algorithm will fine-tune the network. It'll be pretty great I think.
