Worked on the getInputs function, string comparison was borked because strtok
can't run concurrently, so I replaced ti with strtok_r and then fixed the
stupidest C++ error I have ever have the privilage to see. Turns out you can't
use the & operator to refer to the location of the second variable declared in the same
statement, you have to declare each one seperatly, which is so mind-numbingly
stupid becasue it shouldn't mater one iota to the assembler.
