Met with live resource via Skype, talked for like an hour. It was somewhat
helpful I suppose. Then spent a lot of time learning and thinking. I learned
about neural networks, backpropogation, and more on simulated annealing. I'm
still playing around with those concepts by adding some AI to a flight
simulator I started building a couple years ago. I feel like I kind of handle
on this decision making stuff, and am gearing towards a final product.
