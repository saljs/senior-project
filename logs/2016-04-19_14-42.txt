Worked on hardware stuff. Spent the beginning of last week testing the solar
panel to see if it still works, it doesn't. Also, my battery doesn't support
passthrough. So instead of solar charging, I'm just going to connect up a
fifth CDS cell and let the program read that instead of voltage off a panel.
To the robot it won't be any differnt than actually having a solar panel
connected up, only it won't charge anything. Got the control board all wired
up, Everything works real nice. Also, my camera board doesn't work, which is
irritating, so I wired up an old integrated webcam to work over USB. That'll
have to do.
