Senior project log for 2015-09-11_15-09
Time logged: 2.7

Wrote my proposal and rationale. Found a starting place for research,
Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach - 3rd edition. I then installed
git on my server and set up this repository. I think it will be very useful to
keep this project in a revision control system, which will allow me to see
exactly the path it took as I go along. I then spent about half an hour
reveiwing git commands and learning how to effectly use it to it's full
potential. There were many useful features I had never used before. Next I
will begin making an outline for the research phase of the project.
